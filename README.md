# Real-Time-Insights-from-Social-Media

This project aimed to extract and analyze real-time insights from Twitter trends, focusing on both global and US data. 
I retrieved trending topics using Twitter's API, identified common trends, and delved into the popular hashtag #WeLoveTheEarth. Through frequency analysis and data visualization, we uncovered key insights, such as the significant influence of celebrities like Lil Dicky and Leonardo DiCaprio on this trend. 
Language analysis showed English as the predominant language, with notable contributions from Polish, Italian, and Spanish. 
The project highlighted the power of combining data, Python, creativity, and curiosity to derive meaningful insights from social media data.
